description: "Zuleika Dobson, full title Zuleika Dobson, or, an Oxford love story,\
  \ is a 1911 novel by Max Beerbohm, a satire of undergraduate life at Oxford. It\
  \ was his only novel, but was nonetheless very successful. This satire includes\
  \ the famous line \"Death cancels all engagements\" and presents a corrosive view\
  \ of Edwardian Oxford.\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked Zuleika Dobson 59th on\
  \ its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\nThe book\
  \ largely employs a third-person narrator limited to the character of Zuleika (pronounced\
  \ \"Zu-lee-ka\", not \"Zu-like-a\"), then shifting to that of the Duke, then halfway\
  \ through the novel suddenly becoming a first-person narrator who claims inspiration\
  \ from the Greek Muse Clio, with his all-seeing narrative perspective provided by\
  \ Zeus. This allows the narrator to also see the ghosts of notable historical visitors\
  \ to Oxford, who are present but otherwise invisible to the human characters at\
  \ certain times in the novel, adding an element of the supernatural.\nDr Robert\
  \ Mighall in his Afterword to the New Centenary Edition of Zuleika (Collector's\
  \ Library, 2011), writes: \"Zuleika is of the future.... [Beerbohm] anticipates\
  \ an all-too-familiar feature of the contemporary scene: the D-list talent afforded\
  \ A-list media attention.\"\nBeerbohm began writing the book in 1898, finishing\
  \ in 1910, with Heinemann publishing it 26 October 1911. He saw it was not as a\
  \ novel, rather \"the work of a leisurely essayist amusing himself with a narrative\
  \ idea.\" Sydney Castle Roberts wrote a parody Zuleika in Cambridge (1941).\n\n\n\
